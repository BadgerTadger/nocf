            <p>For last year’s event, we deliberated long and hard regarding the issues of staging the stay exercises at the Class Champs.</p>
            <p>All stays had to be scheduled for after all ringwork in that class was completed in order that no competitor would be unfairly disadvantaged.  Shorter days and early onset of darkness, plus the unpredictable weather in November, meant that outside stays were not an option, we explored alternative undercover areas in the vicinity without success, so stays were put indoors at the far end of the venue, but this was far from ideal.</p>
            <p>This year, higher levels of entries are expected, meaning more dogs and we are unable to increase the size of the stay ring due to constraints of legal safety (access to fire exits and disabled toilets).</p>
            <p>We are very concerned for the safety of the competing dogs and Dave Banks as Chief Steward has voiced his worries too, as we are unable to provide the size of ring needed, nor are we able to suitably segregate dogs and bitches.  Also, during the lower class stay exercises, there would be higher classes still working in close proximity.</p>
            <p>So, the organisers have again discussed the matter at length, exploring all options and in agreement with this year’s judges, a decision has been made.</p>
            <p>We are mindful of the fact that all competing dogs will have proved their ability to do stays on numerous occasions in order to gain their qualifiers.</p>
            <p>So, we are able to announce that there will be NO stay exercises at NOCF 2015!</p>
