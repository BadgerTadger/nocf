                judging in PreBeginners and Beginners starts at 10:00 a.m. Judging in all other classes starts at 9:00 a.m. and there will be a full running order, including provision for lunch and breaks, 
                which will be set in advance to assist handlers and spectators to plan their day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only those competing and event officials will be permitted in the area of the rings.  Only the dogs competing and waiting to compete, 
                with the permission of the Collecting Ring Stewards, will be permitted in the hall whilst competition is taking place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flash photography will NOT be allowed at any time while dogs are competing as this may distract the dogs working.  
                There will be official photographers present during the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where necessary, class run offs will take place after Stay and Scent exercises, and will consist of ringwork only.

                <strong>Presentations!</strong><br />
                We have carefully planned the whole day, utilising the class timings from the Kennel Club Rules.  
                We anticipate that the Presentation Ceremony will take place at approximately 5:00 p.m.  The trophies are spectacular, the rosettes 
                absolutely gorgeous, and the presentation is an event not to be missed under any circumstances!

                <strong>Spectators</strong><br />
                Spectators are welcome, at £5.00 per head, and tickets can be purchased in advance or on the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                We hope that as many spectators as possible will attend to support the competitors in this pioneering gala event; 
                we will have trade stands for your Christmas shopping and a full day of obedience competitions which will showcase the winning 
                competitors at each level of the sport and closing with a Presentation Ceremony.  There will also be refreshments and food available all day.
            </p>

                <strong>Remember...</strong><br />
                ... These are your Finals and without you, they won't happen!  Whether you are competing, helping out on the day or 
                just spectating, your support is most welcome so we thank you in advance and we hope you have a wonderful, spectacular day!
