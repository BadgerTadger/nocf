                I should have been at a dog show. I should have been in the depths of Leicestershire at Midlands Border Collie Club, 
                for the BCCGB show, but snow stopped play. If I had been, things may well have been very different and this event may not be happening!

                Good Friday, Easter 2013. I am lying in bed, contemplating getting up and taking the dogs for a walk, when the idea pops into my head, 
                mostly formed, of an Obedience Class Championships – a championship event featuring all levels of obedience from beginners to C, 
                the winner being crowned the class champion for that year!

                They say a picture is worth a thousand words and it would take that long for me to describe the formed picture that flashed into my mind, 
                the chance for 'normal' obedience competitors to enter an annual Class Championships. The more I thought about it, the more ideas flooded 
                in to clarify the concept. I thought about it all through the dog walk, refining the details, until I had a workable plan.

                I think it’s fair to say that if I had realised at that point, how much hard work, thought, effort, time, stress and battles with the 
                computer would be involved in transforming that initial vision into a reality, I would probably have just left it as an idea. But it 
                all has to start somewhere – “If not you, then who?” sprang to mind, I knew how it had to be, if I got the support then I had to go on.  
                I called some frined,s and recruited some help to form a 'committee' of sorts.

                We refined the initial vision into a workable plan with 2 options, but it was ambitious and big, and we had no funds at all.  
                We needed to start on a smaller scale, just a 1 day event with no regional semi finals as originally envisaged, and put the onus on 
                competitors to be responsible for satisfying the qualifying criteria.

                Then we thought about potential venues and after much researching, phone and facebook discussions and emails flying back and forth, 
                came up with a central venue with all the facilities we needed – the Kennel Club Building! So I booked the only date left when we 
                could have the whole building, 22 November 2014. In numerology, both 22 and 11 are Master numbers, so it looked like destiny had a 
                strong hand in this too.

                Fate again seemed to play a part when we applied for a grant from the Kennel Club Legacy Investment Fund... and were selected!  
                However, one of the conditions attached to the award was that we had to find a new name for the event from 2015 onwards, without 
                the word "championships" in it - and so the National Obedience Finals were born!
