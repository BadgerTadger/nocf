            <ul>
                <li>The Qualifying period for entries is 6 October 2015 – 3 October 2016.</li>
                <li>Qualifying will be based on a points system, similar to that used in the Obedience Excellent qualifications.</li>
                <li>Points will be gained for being placed 1st – 6th at any Open and Championship obedience shows held in the UK within the qualifying period above.</li>
                <li>All Qualifying Points for entry must have been earned by the dog (PB and Beg refers).</li>
                <li>
                    Points will be allocated as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1st 10 points</li>
                        <li>2nd 8 points</li>
                        <li>3rd 6 points</li>
                        <li>4th 4 points</li>
                        <li>5th 2 points</li>
                        <li>6th 1 point</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Points can be used to qualify for the class in which they are attained only – for example, points gained for places in class ‘A’ may only be accumulated to qualify for the ‘A’ Class at the 
                    National Obedience Class Finals and may not be transferred to another class, even if the dog is currently eligible to compete at the Novice level.</li>
                <li>
                    Qualifying points needed for each class are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>PreBeginner 10 points</li>
                        <li>Beginner 15 points</li>
                        <li>Novice/Class ‘A’/Class ‘B’ 20 points</li>
                        <li>Class ‘C’ 15 points</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A dog can be entered in 1 class only, but handlers may enter more than 1 dog, as long as each dog is suitably qualified for the class in which it is entered.</li>
                <li>In the event that a dog accumulates sufficient points in 2 or more classes during the qualifying period, the dog should be entered in the HIGHEST class for which it is qualified.</li>
                <li>Handlers who have been fortunate enough to win a Championship Class ‘C’ in 2016 will not be eligible to compete in the National Obedience Class Finals at any level.</li>
                <li>Entries in all classes will be capped - See <a href="Entries.aspx">Entries</a> page.</li>
